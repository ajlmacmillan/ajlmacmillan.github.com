# Living Copy

## 🌐 About

This site is a space for me to share my journey into creative writing and copywriting.
I'll add short Creative, blog posts, samples of copy, and links to other articles or
publications I find useful. Writing is something I've also wanted to pursue in more
depth so this will allow me document my findings and creations as I develop as a writer
and content creator.
