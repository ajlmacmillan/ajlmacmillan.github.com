# Living Copy

## 🌐 About

This site is a space for me to share my journey into creative writing and copywriting.
I'll add short works of fiction, blog posts, samples of copy, and links to other articles
or publications I find interesting or useful. I want to pursue writing as a hobby and
potential income stream in more depth so this will allow me to document my findings and
creations as I develop as a writer and content creator.
