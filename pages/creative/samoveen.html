                            Light years numbering their billions separated
                            Akstos from his home planet of Samoveen. A
                            succession of undiscovered bodies of dust, chemical
                            compounds, and rock. Space he had fought hard and
                            paid dearly for in the crossing, to end up standing
                            broken and hopeless in this final location. Watching
                            the skies, here on the precipice of a mountain of
                            ice, gazing over a vast lake of liquid hydrogen, he
                            knew this was where it had to end. He had no idea if
                            Samoveen still existed, it was unlikely it did. It
                            was all he could do to think about those he had left
                            behind. Phermeth stood next him with a device in her
                            hand, a tool that could bring retribution to it all.
                            Gripping its cold black handle in her steely fingers
                            she too knew what was at stake, and how great the
                            sacrifice was to be to bring an end to the madness.
                            Only two of them had survived, and willingly,
                            neither would live to see the moons of Samoveen
                            again.

                            Sitting at the translucent dining table, Ophrestus
                            called out for her life partner to refill the empty
                            glasses that littered the surface. Her voice rang
                            like the high-pitch vibration of a metal tuning fork
                            on crystal.

                            “More wine, do you hear Akstos?“ she said playfully.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-squeeze">
                            “Haven't you had enough already, Ophrestus?” he
                            smiled brightly as he wrapped his arm around her and
                            began to pour.

                            Twinelight.”

                        <p class="p-squeeze">
                            There were eleven others gathered for the occasion.
                            A great honour was to be held in Akstos' name the
                            following day and the friends were celebrating and
                            making merry with their loved ones before his
                            departure. The humble Servant would be known as a
                            Gelder from that point onwards. The distinguished
                            change to his title meant a significant rise in
                            status, a new dwelling, higher income, extended
                            access to the Planet Gardens, and of course his
                            choice from a range of Horizen interstellar craft,
                            latest models.

                            The party went on late into the night, the light
                            dwindling over the dwelling as the Core Star
                            disappeared behind the towering hills of Trenaught,
                            only for it to be flooded with bright pink moon
                            light several hours later from the four moons of
                            Samoveen.

                            “Such a privilege to have a Gelder in the circle”
                            observed one of the guests. “We'll be fending off
                            the hordes of admirers and sycophants in good time
                            no doubt”, she added, with cynicism.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-squeeze">
                            “It's the cost of success,” came another voice. “The
                            planet only has a handful of Gelders, it goes
                            without saying there will be interest in his circle
                            and where he came from.”

                            A murmur of agreement echoed around the group.
                            Suddenly, Ophrestus brought her hand down violently
                            on the table-top, knocking several glasses to the
                            floor.

                            “Let them come,” she snarled with teeth bared.
                            “Jealousy has always been a stain on the species,
                            let them prove their inadequacy with their pathetic
                            actions.”

                        <p class="p-squeeze">
                            A cheer went up around the table, glasses raised and
                            warm-hearted embraces brought them closer than ever,
                            knowing one of their own would soon be exalted.
                        </p>

                            “Give us a speech Akstos, a parting word to remember
                            the night before you left us for the splendours of
                            Gelder life,” a good friend cried.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-squeeze">
                            Akstos, despite his achievements, was not one for
                            fanfares and ceremony. He was modest, and had been a
                            good Servant, never allowing ego or bravado to
                            interfere with his duty. As a Gelder he would retain
                            that modesty, not allowing himself to lose his head,
                            as they had heard some do in the tales told by their
                            forbearers. Somewhat grudgingly, he stepped away
                            from Ophrestus to the head of the table and took up
                            his glass, freshly filled with the delicate green
                            wine.

                            the Gelders. I could not have done this without all
                            of you, and my life partner Ophrestus, in
                            particular. The support I've been granted has
                            allowed me to flourish, and what man could ask for
                            more than I have in this life?” He extended a hand
                            across the room in a sweeping gesture, to the
                            delight of the audience. “Truthfully, I did not need
                            this honour, dreams can be just that, never needing
                            to be fulfilled. I would still be a happy man until
                            the end of my days had it not happened.”

                            A great din rose up amongst the circle; clapping,

                            Samoveen had a strong hierarchical system, strictly
                            adhered to by the elite class and the general
                            populace. Unders were below the age of 16 and had
                            few rights of their own; they were the
                            responsibility of their Guardians until adulthood
                            and served as helpers and spare hands to those
                            above. Upon coming of age, an Under was given a
                            Cosmos head ring. This came with the title of Seer
                            and allowed the youth to have access to currency,
                            travel between sectors, start attending important
                            circle gatherings and importantly, take a partner.
                            The planet was made up largely of Seers; ordinary
                            folks contributing to improve the sector, conducting
                            research, and starting families.

                            A Servant was a member of a higher tier of citizens
                            that governed within their circle. They sat as the
                            heads of circle meetings and joined cross-sector
                            gatherings as circle representatives to discuss the
                            progression of the sector. Progression was measured
                            by scientific achievement, as the primary goal of
                            the inhabitants of Samoveen was technological
                            advancement. The species had come a long way since
                            the days of single planet habitation on Earth;
                            humanity now enjoyed a sprawling network of
                            connected planets across distant galaxies, with
                            planetary travel being reduced to days, instead of
                            years. Hardly anyone ever visited Earth anymore. It
                            was a barren landscape with great deserts where the
                            seas once crashed and roared. Unbearable heat
                            dominated the atmosphere, with air that was too
                            thick to breath with dust and carbon dioxide in
                            abundance due to the loss of vegetation. Educational
                            expeditions and researchers would go sometimes to
                            perform analysis and conduct history lessons, but
                            rarely would anyone set foot on the surface.

                            Earth life had required that many manual tasks be
                            performed by humans to keep the population alive.

                            a need for human presence. On Samoveen, biological
                            hybrid robotics handled over 99% of tasks previously
                            carried out by humans. Humans were now exclusively
                            researchers, grouped into sectors that worked within
                            exclusive areas of development. Research involved
                            working to design better systems for maintaining the
                            sentinels used for all elements of modern life

                            Cosmos ring, to gargantuan bio-machines the size of

                            protection, but humanity did not want to relinquish

                            was dedicated to ensuring these controls were robust

                            that left the crew pulled back in their seats, faces

                            the Cosmos ring and the unfathomable forces the
                            human body had to endure during the journey. The
                            chassis of the Horizen craft was designed to reduce
                            velocity-based effects to zero, so much so that the
                            pilot would not even know if they were stationary or
                            in motion. The forces on the fluids of the body
                            still gave away the conditions to the brain, causing
                            a chemical reaction to keep the pilot alert to
                            present dangers. When the Cosmos ring released its
                            own nano-chemical compounds to combine with natural
                            human fight-or-flight adrenalin, the resulting
                            toxins produced the effect of blissfully floating

                            nausea and brutal black-outs of former high-speed

                            A five-month long series of missions proceeded this
                            one, each giving the Gelders of Samoveen time to

                            the colonies they visited. The final mission was to
                            Forastices, a semi-formed and partially inhabited
                            world that was undergoing dramatic change, with
                            little support due to an unexplained fall in
                            population. The planet had been given use of two of
                            the galaxies most advanced sentinels; Hymperico, for
                            atmospheric conditioning, and Glostacirus for land

                            as the air quality had not stabilised, and the
                            landscape could not yet support growth. Life support
                            suits were still a requirement, and it was here that
                            the Gelders of Samoveen were most welcome, as the
                            outstanding work was fast becoming unwieldy for the
                            few resident Gelders.

                            The event happened on Forastices. The
                            inter-planetary network of sentinel adjudicators
                            responsible for intentional analysis and operational
                            restriction failed at a node that was caught under

                            strict protocols. Hymperico was a universally
                            accepted standard for atmospheric manipulation; it
                            had never failed and had never harmed a planet or
                            its colony. Now, it has disrupted the ring-fence

                            As the planets of nearby galaxies learnt of the
                            event, they would come to blame Akstos, and the few
                            Gelders of Forastices for the fallout. The three
                            Gelders of Samoveen only escaped Forastices with
                            their lives, owing to Phermeth being able to briefly
                            intoxicate the Hymperico using a cylo-bomb to flood
                            the atmosphere with a potent toxin, deadly to any
                            human. The damaging effect was not long lasting
                            enough on the bio-machines, however. Within seconds
                            of the crew's departure from Forastices, the
                            bio-machines had produced anti-toxins and started to
                            override the consensus mechanisms of the ring-fence,
                            and one-by-one, the adjacent colonies were reduced
                            to nothing as they enacted their revenge on the
                            humans they saw as their captors and slave masters.
                            Samoveen was soon surrounded by sentinels that had
                            bypassed network protection, it was not safe for the
                            group to try and get close enough to land. It pained
                            each of them to turn away, but to try and survive,
                            they would not be travelling back to Samoveen.

                            Tearing across galaxies, floating from one end of

                            eventually came to a frozen planet hitherto

                            wore when entering worlds that had yet to be
                            terraformed. They had managed to land on a plane of
                            ice on top of a mountain 4500 miles high, on a
                            planet so far from home it felt like a pointless
                            gesture being there at all. What were they now
                            fighting for? They had come to the frozen end of the
                            known universe, all else reduced to dust, no loved
                            ones to go home to, no planet to even call home. It
                            was natural for Phermeth to want to hold off using
                            the device she now gripped in those steely fingers.
                            Even after watching Persis' craft turn into a
                            fireball as its fusion reactor destabilised, she
                            still struggled to see a vision of the near future
