                        <p>
                            It was a normal day, much the same as any other day
                            in recent times. The same jobs needed doing, the
                            same on and off gloomy weather with the occasional
                            ray of sunshine brightening up the fields, and the
                            same peaceful stillness that abounded in the
                            beautiful rural scene the farmer looked out over
                            every morning. He awoke before sunrise to the sounds
                            of the animals in the fields, and after bathing and
                            putting on his clothes, he stepped out of the
                            farmhouse into the crisp winter air. It was cold and
                            wet, but not raining very hard, just a fine mist
                            that clouded the horizon, settling gently on his
                            clothes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having left the farmhouse, he walked along the
                            gravelled pathway toward the barn as usual but
                            stopped. Something was not right. Unable to put his
                            finger on what exactly, there was something odd
                            about the farm that cold January morning. Despite
                            everything seeming to be as it should, he could not
                            help but feel a coldness that was unconnected to the
                            morning’s weather. He felt he was not alone; a sense
                            of presence made him turn and look back at the
                            farmhouse. Again, all was as he would expect but the
                            feeling remained. He and his wife were childless, so
                            they were the only two people who lived on the farm.
                            His role was to work the fields and tend the
                            livestock while she kept the house and farm
                            well-maintained and looked after her husband’s
                            business affairs. The farmer was not a man of
                            numbers and did not care for the business side of
                            the farm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As he looked back at the farmhouse, the wind began
                            to blow fiercely, the cold biting into him so hard
                            he turned from his thoughts and headed quickly
                            towards the barn. Inside, it was damp and smelt
                            strongly of straw and rotting wood. He could hear
                            some of the animals in the fields crying out: sheep
                            bleating, the distant moo of the cows, and the pigs
                            in their pen snorting. The first job was to feed the
                            animals. The door to the barn was heavy with a thick
                            bar allowing him to shut it behind himself. As he
                            was reluctant to brave the icy winds again just yet,
                            he decided to take care of the pigs first. A creaky
                            old door joined the barn to the pig pens, which he
                            had meant to oil the hinges of for a long time. He
                            scooped up a large bucket of pig feed from a storage
                            container, then made his way into the pens with the
                            door creaking behind him. It banged shut loudly,
                            startling the pigs, causing them to shuffle away
                            from him as he approached. Realising he had brought
                            breakfast, they soon forgot about the door and came
                            hungrily over to the rapidly filling troughs. Soon,
                            the sound of grunting and snorting grew as he filled
                            each trough. He came to the last pen to feed a
                            mother and her recent litter to find that three of
                            the piglets were missing. She had birthed seven
                            healthy young piglets not four days ago, yet here
                            there were only four. He looked in to see if they
                            were perhaps hiding timidly behind their mother but
                            could only see the four. Pouring out the last of the
                            feed as the mother began to eat, he climbed into the
                            pen. Maybe here, under this straw, he would find
                            them huddled for warmth. Strangely, there was no
                            sign of the lost litter. There was, however,
                            something else there; a small carved piece of wood,
                            six or seven inches in length, had been hidden under
                            the straw. He changed the straw daily, and his wife
                            did not come to the pig pens often, so it made
                            little sense that this ornament should be tucked
                            away here like this. He picked it up to examine it
                            closely. It bore some symbols that he did not
                            recognise but he could clearly make out a face, that
                            of a woman, carved at the tip of it. Her face was
                            twisted in a scream; her eyes seemed to stare
                            straight through him as he brought it up to his
                            face. The carving was intricately detailed for the
                            size, and for a moment he thought he recognised the
                            woman. She seemed to be crying out to him but there
                            were no words for him to hear. Suddenly, the main
                            door to the barn banged shut loudly, causing him to
                            drop the carving and making the animals rear back
                            from their feed into groups, clustered into the
                            corners of their pens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He turned sharply. He was still alone, apart from
                            his pigs and their young. The pigs did not return to
                            their food but stayed in their corners, safety in
                            numbers. The farmer picked up the carving and jumped
                            out of the pen, then left through the joining door
                            to see what had happened. The wooden framework of
                            the old building screamed in the howling wind. The
                            sheet metal that had been nailed onto the roof to
                            fix a large hole flapped and crashed like thunder.
                            The door was shut, as he had left it. As he gripped
                            the great bar pull it rattled loudly as it swung
                            open. He did not know what he was expecting; maybe
                            his wife had come down with some news, maybe it had
                            been the wind, but there was no one there on the
                            other side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He shut the door again, holding onto the bar as it
                            shut so as not to let it slam. It was quiet now, no
                            creaking or crashing, and the animals had gone quiet
                            in the pens and in the fields. He turned again,
                            aware of something that he could not explain. The
                            hair on the back of his neck rose, as did the wind.
                            Having fed the pigs, he pulled his cap down and
                            turned up the collar on his jacket as he prepared to
                            go outside and back to the farmhouse. He had placed
                            the carving in his pocket. He hastily kicked the mud
                            off his boots at the front door then noisily went
                            inside, splashing rainwater and mud in the hallway.
                            Taking off his jacket and boots, he started up the
                            stairs to go and see his wife, who liked to sleep
                            later than he did. The house was dark, and he could
                            hear the wind whistling down the chimney. Not
                            getting far, he had only put a foot on the first
                            stair before stopping. Whose voice had he heard? It
                            was a woman’s voice, but unlike his wife’s. The
                            house was usually warm and bright by the time he
                            came back from feeding the animals but since he had
                            come back early, it was still cold, no fire or
                            lights on to comfort him. He was used to the
                            coldness of the house first thing every morning, but
                            this was different. He started back up the stairs,
                            taking extraordinary care to minimise the sound of
                            his footsteps. His wife tended to snore when she
                            slept. He stopped and listened. Silence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Continuing to the top, he held his breath so he
                            could hear anything that might be there to be heard.
                            He heard his heart beating, and his slow release of
                            breath wheezing nervously as he approached the door
                            to their bedroom. A sound from downstairs. It could
                            have been a teacup being placed on a saucer. Or
                            possibly cutlery on a ceramic plate. His
                            outstretched hand, reaching for the doorknob, froze.
                            He stood for a few moments, unsure whether to go
                            into the bedroom or to investigate the sound from
                            downstairs. He became overwhelmed with concern for
                            his wife and barged into the room, shattering the
                            silence of the house and cried out to her, but she
                            was not in there. He half ran, half fell backwards
                            out the room and tripped on the hallway carpet,
                            nearly sending him down the stairs. He cried out for
                            her again, in panic now. He went down into the
                            kitchen. Indeed, a small plate and a knife sat on
                            the table, freshly used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A realisation came over him, he had not kissed his
                            wife’s forehead as she slept next to him before
                            leaving the house this morning, as was his custom.
                            He tried to think. He could not recall her being in
                            bed with him when he had woken, and nor did he
                            recall finding it odd that she was not there. He
                            stood in his kitchen, staring at the plate on the
                            table. Time stood still for a moment before he came
                            back to himself. He rushed outside where it was now
                            warmer but still chilly. The rain had eased, and the
                            sun had risen, shining brightly through the light
                            grey clouds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only one thought consumed him. Where was his wife?
                            He stared up at the hose from the driveway. It was a
                            large house, far larger than the two of them needed.
                            A vast loft made up the third floor. Their room was
                            located on the first floor, no sense in having to
                            climb more stairs to go to bed they thought. They
                            had chosen the room that overlooked the farm. He
                            enjoyed sitting at that window in the evening after
                            a long day and looking at the fields and the
                            animals. The distant mountains were beautiful on a
                            clear day, and on a day like this the mist that
                            covered the mountain tops left him melancholy yet at
                            rest. Was that movement in the top window? Or a
                            reflection of a passing cloud? What would she be
                            doing up there in the loft? They lived modestly
                            without many possessions, so the space went largely
                            unused. Could he trust his eyes? He was sure he had
                            seen someone moving at the window. Back into the
                            house, foot on the bottom stair. Whistling wind,
                            cold, sweat on his back turning icy, up to the first
                            floor, bedroom door still hanging open. The second,
                            unfamiliar, dusty, and dimly lit by the single bulb
                            that hung from the ceiling. There were no windows in
                            this part of the house. The loose floorboards spoke
                            to him as he trod lightly across them, whispering
                            messages to him. Another set of stairs, a light
                            switch that had not worked in years. He wanted to go
                            straight up, but not without a light. There was a
                            torch in the kitchen drawer. Carefully back
                            downstairs to rummage through drawers full of things
                            he did not need, to find the one thing he did. Once
                            found he was back on the third floor at the door to
                            the loft. The air was stale and thick with dust. It
                            had started to rain again, thunder cracking on the
                            hills as he went inside. Did he hear the squeal of a
                            young pig? It must have been the door, no sense in
                            there being pigs up here. He stepped into the large,
                            empty space. The only window at the front of the
                            house let a beam of soft light in past an old
                            curtain, so one end was partially lit. Darting the
                            torch around, the room was bare. Apart from that, on
                            the floor at the far end. He walked gingerly
                            forward, training the torch on the far corner. Three
                            pigs. Only babes. Lifeless and bloody. With a knife
                            left beside them. The stains on the knife were
                            unmistakable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He ran the torch over them, unable to blink and
                            paralysed with fear. The cold returned. How could
                            someone do this? Why would they do it? He had to
                            find his wife. He flashed the torch around
                            frantically now and noticed the wood shavings.
                            Whoever did this must have carved that thing, the
                            woman in pain. Fear took him, it lifted him off the
                            ground and out of his senses, please say she is
                            alright, for God’s sake, let her be alright.
                            Dropping the torch and taking the stairs three steps
                            at a time he was back outside into daylight, rain
                            now soaking his face and wetting his socks, no time
                            for boots. Apart from the house the only place in
                            sight was the barn. Go to the barn. Running and
                            slamming through the solid side door into the pig
                            pens first, sharp pain all down his left side.
                            Scared animals squealing as he charged in, furiously
                            looking around for anything, a sign of her,
                            something. He made his way through the pens and into
                            the barn. The door slammed behind him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How did he not notice her absence from their bed
                            this morning? Could she have done that to the pigs?
                            The carving, what of that? A creaking noise above, a
                            rope perhaps? Dare to look, scrunch up the eyelids,
                            and pretend it’s not real. Did not see the figure
                            hanging from the beam in the rafters. Could be
                            someone else, anybody, a stranger. So hard to make
                            out a face, only a twisted mouth, open to shout but
                            unable to speak. Must know, climb the ladder to the
                            top to face the horror. Lightheaded and dizzy,
                            walking so high up, towards the figure. A rope in
                            his hand, he could not remember taking it. Forward a
                            little more. The figure is wearing her night gown,
                            fight the tears and the desire to scream. Have not
                            seen her face yet. A little closer, the face turns
                            to me, eyes meet mine, black matted hair hangs about
                            her as the figure swings. Cannot look away, cannot
                            bear to look. Why would she do this? The rope in my
                            hands, only one choice. How did I get here? Swing
                            the rope over the nearest rafter and tie it to the
                            supporting beam behind. I don't remember. Take a
                            step toward the edge. Must I do this? Put the rope
                            over my head. Yes, I must.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The farmer’s wife drove into the courtyard of the
                            farm, the sound of gravel crunching under the car
                            tyres. She stepped out of the car to unload the
                            shopping. She called to her husband to give her a
                            hand as there were a few heavy bags to bring in. The
                            front door to the house was open, the farm quiet.
                            She called again but to no response. Strange she
                            thought. She took what she could into the kitchen
                            and placed the bags on the kitchen table, knocking
                            over the plate that was sitting there, smashing it
                            on the tiled floor. She jumped at the sound. As she
                            went to the store cupboard to get the broom, she
                            found it locked. Her husband kept the key on his key
                            ring. She called for him through the house. Why has
                            he left his jacket on the peg if he is outside? It
                            is not the time of year for him to leave it indoors.
                            Going to the jacket to check the pockets, no keys
                            but only a strange wooden carving. How odd, she
                            thought as she looked it over. She could not discern
                            who, but a familiar face was looking back at her.
                            The eyes full of anguish and sorrow, the mouth ugly
                            and terrifying. What could this be? Where are you,
                            George she uttered. She was cold. She had not
                            noticed until now, but she was trembling with it.
                            She looked at the carving, and a woman’s voice spoke
                            to her. The barn, go to the barn….
