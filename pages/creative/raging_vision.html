                        <p>Terrified, aching, and moving fast.</p>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever run so hard you felt yourself start to
                            choke on blood? That iron taste and roaring throat?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feeling like your body is fuelled on caustic soda.
                            All this pain, just to make it home from the office.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the world I live in.</p>
                        <p>
                            I work seventeen hours a day. I can sleep 3 hours a
                            night if I'm lucky. The additives ensure I can be a
                            productive, functional member of the new society.
                            The drops go straight in the eyes before any food or
                            drink is taken. The body rejects the food over time
                            if not pre-emptively supplemented by the stinging
                            sensation of the drops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nearly three decades have passed since the collapse.
                            Our old way of life has been stripped away. Time has
                            taken more innocent lives than I can comprehend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Rulers took over the offices, the skyscrapers,
                            the Halls of the Rich and Powerful. Every other
                            building, save these deprived estates in which I
                            live, is rubble.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The air drops on the estate roofs keep us alive. The
                            retinal scanners at the offices keep us on the list
                            of places to drop the packages. No eyes, no drops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The route from the estate to my nearest office is
                            like a warzone. The partially sighted and blind
                            victims of this new order of autocracy have no
                            choice but to scavenge on what they can take, or
                            face becoming another body in the dust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many refused to turn wild, opting for a quick end to
                            what little life they had. Many did not have the
                            courage. Thousands lined the routes from the estates
                            to offices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was a gauntlet of survival through the decaying
                            streets of the desperate and starving. The eye drops
                            giving me the energy to run like an animal. I had
                            pure strength in the first few hours. The run took
                            just over an hour in each direction. Needed a solid
                            dose when first waking, and a double hit to make it
                            home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The work was intricate. Eye strain plagued me and
                            the others. Tiny components, screens, harsh
                            lighting. There were no Rulers, only other workers
                            silently head down. They did not need to oversee us.
                            The threat of cutting off the air drops was enough
                            to make sure we were on time and did our work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The retinal scanners on every door and workstation
                            flashed orange as we passed. A constant reminder. No
                            retinal scan that day? No food. Simple. Our eyes
                            were our keys to life. No eyes, no life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had wanted to save O'Conner. She had been my
                            friend before she turned wild. Now she existed
                            amongst the rubble, feeding on carrion birds, rough
                            vegetation that was hard to digest, and the
                            Unthinkable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The air drops only provided enough resources for a
                            single person. Retinal scanner protected, one drop
                            per-person. Daily top ups of eye drops. Water.
                            Bread. Milk. Ham. Nothing else. All packaged in
                            small receptacles. O'Conner had lived with me until
                            her eyes failed. We had tried to share but it was
                            not enough for two. I had to decide. Every day now I
                            think of trying to save her. Sometimes I see her
                            staggering towards me on the run. Arms out like the
                            undead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been caught twice. Beaten badly, scratched, and
                            bitten. Managed to twist my ankle and went down in
                            an area with hundreds of them, only just escaped
                            with my life to get in and do most of a shift. There
                            was no air drop that evening.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wonder how much longer I have. My eyes feel worse
                            every day. When the strain becomes too much, I won't
                            be able to work anymore, and I'll be forced to join
                            O'Conner when the others who live in my estate evict
                            me. The Rulers made it impossible to store rations.
                            There was no electricity, so no fridge. The constant
                            heat meant food would not last well. The atmosphere
                            was like a greenhouse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today I am going to the office. I'll do my work, and
                            I'll make it home. I'll use extra eye drops. I've
                            had an idea. I'm not going to open the air drop
                            today. See if I can save it till tomorrow. It'll be
                            hard not to eat the food, but I need to see if it's
                            possible. I've spent so many years not trying to
                            find out what, if anything, I can do to escape.
                            Brutal repetitiveness, exhaustion, and the comfort
                            of knowing the air drop will be waiting have
                            shackled us all into submission. If I don't change
                            something, I'll go mad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It worked. I now have two open air drops, double
                            rations. I was worried the boxes wouldn't open, or I
                            wouldn't get another one the following day. I'm
                            going to do this again to store food for as many
                            days as I can stand. The boxes seem to keep food
                            fresh. Then I'll have food for the road ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We work during daylight. We are only ever on the
                            estate at night. To get a proper look I had to avoid
                            the office today, take my chances. I can only hope
                            the air drops resume once I return to work. I
                            haven't missed a day in all these years. I wait for
                            a clear day and climb onto the roof of the estate.
                            The haze lining the distance makes it so hard to see
                            anything clearly, but I have no choice. This life is
                            not a life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the roof I see pure desolation. I've never seen
                            the scale of it before. Despite the heat, it sends
                            shivers through me to see it. The sun beats down on
                            me as I take it all in, squinting heavily. I'm
                            looking for anything. A building rising out of the
                            landscape, a shimmer, an object of some kind to head
                            for, to see how far I can get.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They know where to send the air drops because this
                            was my declared location when the Rulers took all
                            our information. I have never spoken to another
                            Ruler since. If I leave this place no one will know
                            where I am. If I don't find anything out there, I
                            will certainly die. The rations and eye drops will
                            get me so far, and return will be practically
                            impossible once the resources are gone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I must find something. What would I be returning to
                            anyway? This dilapidated housing, the offices, the
                            work, the dependence on the eye drops to earn my
                            rations. What do I have to lose? Nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After five days of running, working, and starving, I
                            was near broken. So weak it didn't seem possible I
                            would make it a hundred meters, let alone to that
                            towering structure I had glimpsed. It stood like a
                            radio control tower, at its tip a large dish jutting
                            out of the debris. The curve of the Earth limits the
                            distance the human eye can see to around thirty
                            miles from a tall building. I should be able to do
                            that in a day. I remember walking on cliff tops by
                            the sea, decades ago. See that light house? That's
                            where we're walking today. A tiny spec that looked
                            too far away to reach, yet after a few hours, there
                            you are, at the base looking up and enjoying the
                            view out to the ocean.
                        </p>
                        <p>No office today. This is it.</p>
                        <p>
                            I got no air drop last night, so I have five small
                            boxes wrapped in a sheet which I've tied round the
                            end of a stick. I look like an apocalyptic
                            Huckleberry Finn. An old shirt wrapped round my head
                            to protect from the sun. I start by going back up to
                            the roof to get my bearings. I can't see the tower
                            today. The skyline is like mud. Browns and oranges
                            curdling together on the horizon. The burning haze
                            hanging low, making the ground wobble and jitter. I
                            can't wait another day for it to be clearer. I have
                            a best effort idea of where I'm heading. Looking
                            straight down I see the wild hanging around outside
                            the estate and beyond. Waiting for people going to
                            and from work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hit the eye drops. Two doses in each eye. Might be
                            overkill but I need a good start. Couldn't see any
                            wild beyond the estate so hopefully just need to
                            make it out and into the wilderness. I'll be
                            completely alone, but free.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I run down the stairwell, nearly falling and killing
                            my chances before leaving the building. Managed to
                            catch myself though and only graze my hand on the
                            wall. Once outside I make sure I know the direction
                            and run fast. The stick isn't making it easy, as it
                            wobbles around behind me, so I take each end of it
                            and rest it across my shoulders, elbows out at head
                            height. I clear the estate in around two hours. I
                            can tell from the way the sun has moved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I'm away from it all. Away from that life, and
                            deep in the rubble. No idea what to expect, or who I
                            might see. What if I find the Rulers? They would
                            probably kill me. I need to make the most of the eye
                            drops I used. I stopped thinking and get a steady
                            pace. Sprinting. I can do this for a few hours then
                            fall back to walking the rest. I opened one box for
                            this outward journey. The tiny bites and hydration
                            would be sufficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>I've reached an old car park.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rusting relics littered the place, hot tarmac felt
                            through the soles of my shoes. I can see the tower
                            now. Aside from the estates, not a single building
                            seems to have survived whatever it was the Rulers
                            used to sack the cities, apart from this rising
                            metal monument. I could only think it must be a
                            communication tower they had protected. Some piece
                            of vital infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Standing at the base of it I got a flashback of
                            being on that cliff. I was at the foot of a
                            beautiful lighthouse. The rolling clouds and
                            crashing waves stretching out for miles ahead of me.
                            This was the most I had <i>felt</i> in a long time.
                            I broke down in tears uncontrollably. I hadn't had
                            an image of my previous life in so long I'd
                            forgotten most of it. This tower brought me closer
                            to myself than I'd been in years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After sitting and crying I felt an alien wave of
                            joy. A release from the horrors of the estates and
                            the offices. To be out here, alone, and with nothing
                            save my boxes and this tower, I felt <i>hope</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The eyes drops had worn off. The restless feeling in
                            my limbs they created now forced me onto my feet. I
                            touched the tower and made the decision to climb it.
                            It was taller than the estate, I would be able to
                            see further into the distance from the top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I clung to the poles at its tip. Standing next to
                            the dish. It hummed. There was power running through
                            it from somewhere. From up here I could look back to
                            the estate and even see past it to the offices. I
                            could see further in the direction I was travelling
                            as well. More communication towers. Three in total,
                            in different directions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's impossible to make any kind of logical decision
                            on which one to head to. All look the same as this
                            one. Go down the centre I say. At least that way I
                            can see what's on each side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I spend days doing this. Covering what feels like
                            hundreds of miles. A routine of run, snack, drink,
                            drop, climb. Eventually, I find something
                            incredible. I've climbed a tower and can see a
                            mirage, I think. The heat must be getting to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the centre of a blast radius of flattened
                            buildings stands a lush jungle. It doesn't look
                            real. The burnt sky and scorched landscape, not the
                            right surrounding for vegetation like that. This
                            can't be real. It's like a dream.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More astonishing was the building in the middle of
                            the jungle. A palace. Gold domes, alabaster walls,
                            azul blue finishing's on the features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If it's real, there is no doubt in my mind this
                            place is where the Rulers live.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've got a day's rations left. A few days eye drops.
                            I can't even imagine seeing one of those people.
                            What would either of us do? I'd need a big drop
                            before getting anyway near the palace. Fear and
                            anxiety grip me like a vice. Aching temples and
                            tight chest. Not what I want at the top of this
                            tower. I need to get down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Back on the ground I take a drop. The focus is on
                            me. I need to be able to think and move.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I get a speed going until I'm able to see the edge
                            of the jungle from the ground. I rest, eat half the
                            rations, then dig a sleeping hole. If I see one of
                            those bastards, I don't know what I'll do. Take one
                            with me at least if it comes to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I sleep that night and wake up with the first light.
                            I eat and drink the remaining rations, keep the
                            stick but leave everything else here. I'm going into
                            the jungle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've just applied all the remaining eye drops. This
                            is the most I've had in one go. Shit. I could run
                            10k in six minutes right now. My heart and glands
                            beating to an unstoppable rhythm. Fingertips
                            pulsating. I can see rain falling in the jungle. It
                            hasn't rained in twenty years. The dream-like
                            feeling is there. I'm in a strong state of focus,
                            but nothing makes sense. I'm at the edge and have to
                            pass under a sheet of thick clear plastic to enter.
                            I'm instantly sweating with the humidity. I can run
                            my hands along the bark of moist palms and mahogany.
                            Rain lands on my face and I could die now, in sheer
                            bliss. A tropical heaven. A respite from the arid
                            world I came from.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hear animals. Monkeys, and birds. The trees rustle
                            with movement. A gentle wind washes over me, helping
                            to cool me down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Great pipework is hidden among the trees. Stems from
                            the ground and emits clouds of steam at frequent
                            intervals. Like a hot house in a botanical garden. A
                            vast system of underground vapour dispensers
                            protrudes out the surface uniformly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They have made themselves very comfortable here.
                            Everything a person could want. An opulent palace
                            surrounded by a rich habitat. How could they be so
                            cruel, knowing how we live our lives in the estates?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I turn from the wonder of the wildlife to reach the
                            palace. I'm sprinting, every muscle burning. Jumping
                            vines and narrow winding rivers. I swing from low
                            hanging branches. Animal form. Back to my ancient
                            roots. I'm screaming as I run. I must find someone.
                            Must get an answer, regardless of the consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I explode from the jungle on to the lawns. It's like
                            a fantasy. Rhino parades the grounds in herds of
                            eight or more. I have the focus to go straight
                            through them, causing a stampede away from me.
                            Luscious planting is trampled and crushed. Great
                            pots toppled and smashed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I reach the palace. A great door. I listen
                            out but the quiet is either hiding the truth or is
                            reflecting the lack of activity inside. The eye
                            drops won't let me stand here long. Pushing the huge
                            door, it swings open easily, revealing an entrance
                            hall. Winding stairs, balconies, and a ceiling so
                            high I begin to sway as I look up.
                        </p>
                        <p>Not a sound to be heard.</p>
                        <p>
                            Up the stairs and through gold panelled doors.
                            Artistic interiors. Expensive furniture. Light
                            pouring in through towering windows to illuminate
                            the space and cast atmospheric shadows over the
                            perfectly arranged furnishings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I use all the energy I have searching the palace.
                            Not a single person, or even a sign of human
                            inhabitants. Just an immaculately preserved pile,
                            fit for a King.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An overwhelming exhaustion is setting in. I'm barely
                            able to stand suddenly. The marble floor is not
                            inviting enough to let myself pass out on the spot.
                            There was a bedroom off the balcony atop the
                            entrance stairs. I need to make it to the bed, now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Falling up the stairs to the room my peripheral
                            vision is getting darker. My eyes ache so heavily
                            I'm clutching my head. I must've had too many of the
                            drops. Stupid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I land on the mattress like a sack of vegetables
                            hitting a motorway after falling off the back of a
                            truck. I can't move now I'm down. Consciousness is
                            there. Thought. A semblance of touch, but I'm mostly
                            numb. If anyone came in, I'd be entirely
                            defenceless. Still got the focus, but the body can't
                            cope. I need sleep to come. Take away the worry
                            about my vulnerability. I've never done this before,
                            but I start counting sheep. Lying there, in a
                            Sultan's chambers, catatonic, and softly mouthing
                            with dry lips:
                        </p>
                        <p>1 sheep.</p>
                        <p>2 sheep.</p>
                        <p>3 sheep.</p>
                        <p>4 sheep.</p>
                        <p>5 shee...</p>
                        <p>6 sh...</p>
                        <p>7...</p>
                        <p>
                            It's dark when I wake up. I can see the moon through
                            the glass domed ceiling. A feeling of relief that I
                            can move but countered by an intense headache with
                            crippling eye strain. I don't want to stay here.
                            This place is too vast, and too empty. It doesn't
                            feel safe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slowly, I'm up on my feet. I leave the room onto the
                            balcony in the entrance hallway and try to get my
                            senses to align. My hearing is muffled. Eyes are
                            sore. Skin is tingling.
                        </p>
                        <p>No more eye drops left. No more food or drink.</p>
                        <p>
                            This place must have a kitchen. I need to find it
                            before I leave. I start to descend the grand stairs
                            to see hundreds of people in the hallway, standing
                            in total silence. The loud intake of breath it
                            induces rings out audibly. I'm unable to hide here
                            and running will draw attention. No one has even
                            turned to look. These people do not appear to be
                            moving at all, like wax works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I get down with them, move through the crowd. Their
                            eyes are wide and lifeless. Every man and woman,
                            vacant. Transfixed on a point only they could see.
                            Being so close I can see the rugged lines of age,
                            the missing patches in facial hair, scars, and
                            veins. Yet not one of them moves. Their eyes still.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hurry through the crowd to the end of the hallway
                            and make my way through a side door that leads to a
                            long corridor. If I can find a kitchen, fill up with
                            water and maybe find some food, I can leave.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This takes me down into the underbelly of the
                            palace. Tight, dimly lit stairwells. Less regal,
                            more servant's quarters. More claustrophobic. There
                            are no rooms off the corridors, so I just keep
                            following. Eventually I come to a door. A blue,
                            flickering light shines underneath. I try the door,
                            and it opens into a room with a large unit of
                            screens. A table and work bench. Thousands of tiny
                            components are scattered around lazily. The
                            familiarity unmistakable. I built these components
                            in the offices. Small electrical and mechanical
                            gizmos. I never knew why I made them. I just
                            followed the plans left at the bench.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In front of the screens there is a velvet sofa. Each
                            screen shows a room. A room within the estate. I
                            recognise my own pit. The few items of clothing. The
                            old leather chair I sat in, worn to straw in some
                            places.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Horrified, I sit on the sofa staring at the screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A side door opens and a man in impeccable butler's
                            dress enters the room carrying a silver tray.
                            Delicately sitting on it is a glass of Champagne and
                            a plate of food. He puts them down in front of me,
                            gives a crooked smile by raising one corner of his
                            mouth, then turns and leaves without a word.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm rigid with fear.</p>
                        <p>
                            Do I consume these offerings? Who does he think I
                            am?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't want the drink, but the food looks good. I
                            eat the whole plate in a few mouthfuls, swallowing
                            it in chunks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I go back out the way I came in at my natural speed.
                            I'll be back in the hall again. I don't like this
                            prospect. Those people aren't right. I get to the
                            little side door and open it. The crowd is up to the
                            door, all of them staring straight at me now. Still
                            motionless but the eyes are alive. Gaping and
                            unblinking. They don't move towards me. I steady
                            myself and walk into them again and hear a small
                            sound. A mechanical whirring. The bodies don't turn
                            to follow me, but the eyes do. Hundreds of pairs of
                            eyes, operated by tiny components, buzzing quietly
                            as they move in eye sockets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I finally get to the entrance and out into the
                            night. I close the door behind me, and all is
                            silent. My own eyes can't adjust. The night is
                            blurry. Lights flicker in the corner of my vision
                            but disappear as soon as I look at them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm running towards the jungle now, but I can feel
                            my eyesight is going. Either a symptom of dependency
                            or I'm going blind. Colours swim together on a black
                            background. Shapes and forms loom towards me. The
                            trees perhaps. I'm now completely disoriented. I
                            don't know which way I'm facing, or which way I came
                            from.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I can't stop though so I tear onwards to meet my
                            fate.
                        </p>
                        <p>Without warning I feel someone grab me.</p>
                        <p>
                            I'm pulled to the ground. There was more than one. I
                            do all I can by kicking and lashing out. Spitting
                            and screaming, trying to use my teeth when I feel
                            them near my face. Slowly I start to lose
                            consciousness. The world goes dark, and I slip away
                            downstream.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p class="p-separator">=====</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            It was raining heavily outside. Humidity clung to
                            the air in this unusually warm summer. It was the
                            middle of the night, but no one was sleeping.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Janet O'Conner stood over the hospital bed, looking
                            down at her best friend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A nurse nearby was checking a clipboard and doing
                            basic checks for vital signs. A woman was laid out
                            on the bed, having sustained a head injury on the
                            way to work when she passed out on the train.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The impact to the back of her head meant she would
                            lose her sight permanently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After several weeks she was able to sit up on her
                            own. Janet sat beside her in a plastic-coated chair
                            and offered sips of water, or spoonful's of food.
                            Today she was booked in for an experimental
                            procedure to try and recover her sight at least
                            partially. A clinical program needed trial subjects,
                            and the timing was perfect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several days after the surgery, they came to the
                            bedside which Janet had not left. She was in the
                            foetal position on the chair. She uncoiled herself
                            and sat up when the doctor cleared his throat.
                        </p>
                        <p>“Mrs O'Conner?”</p>
                        <p>“Yes.”</p>
                        <p>
                            “We believe the operation to have been a success. We
                            will need to monitor carefully of course, but
                            initial response to the treatment is excellent. Her
                            readings are exactly what we would expect. We are
                            going to remove the bandages now. Can I ask you to
                            wake her for us?”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Janet gently stroked the woman's hair, and spoke
                            softly saying the doctor has come, and needs to
                            remove the bandages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The woman sits up in slow motion. Her entire head
                            wrapped in white. She does as she is asked but never
                            speaks. The doctor explains what he is looking for
                            and asks for consent to approach her to take the
                            bandages off. The woman doesn't respond, so he
                            removes them carefully anyway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the bandages are off, everyone steps back to
                            see the result.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The woman's head is motionless, and she does not
                            make a sound. Two wide eyes track the people in
                            front of her, making a small mechanical whirring
                            sound as they move.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Janet takes a step back. She doesn't recognise the
                            person in front of her anymore.
                        </p>
                        <p>“What have you done?”</p>
                        <p>
                            The doctor reaches into his pocket and produces a
                            small bottle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Make sure she is using these drops. Twice a day,
                            and she'll be just fine.”
