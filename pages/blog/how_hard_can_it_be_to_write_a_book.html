                    <p>
                        I'm writing a novel, a task that's been a dream for a
                        long time. It's been a stop/start affair with poor
                        consistency and zero planning. Writing and, importantly,
                        finishing a book is no mean feat and yet the basic
                        concept is very simple. You don't need to be a professor
                        in languages or a genius in world-building, it comes
                        down to just getting your imagination down in words. The
                        words don't have to be worthy of the great icons of
                        literature, a book can be short and use simple
                        vocabulary, and still be highly engaging. Difficulties
                        can arise since you might put in a lot of work but don't
                        know how to finish it, you may veer off the path and
                        break your story without realising, or in many cases you
                        may have a story in your head but you don't know where
                        to start, or maybe never start due to time constraints
                        or lack of confidence. Stories can live in our minds for
                        a lifetime, but nothing exists on paper unless you
                        commit to it. You must have sat down with friends and
                        family sharing stories or throwing around ideas and
                        someone says something like...
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <b
                            ><i
                                >"That would be a great premise for a book! Have
                                you thought about writing that down?"</i

                        >
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>...and you reply with something like...</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <b
                            ><i

                                never really given it any serious
                                consideration..."</i
                            ></b
                        >

                    <p>
                        Many of us have stories that are worth writing down,
                        whether real or fictional. To start trying to write a
                        book you have to do just that,
                        <i>start writing</i>. For me it began when I was given a
                        beat-up old laptop with nothing on it apart from a word
                        processor and some free games. I had no real use for
                        this machine and while staring at it one day, I had a
                        sudden urge to write something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That was 20 years ago... the book started as some
                        rambling nonsense my 18 year old self thought was funny,
                        and stubbornly the manuscript has followed me until this
                        day in an unfinished state being carted around on
                        storage devices, lost multiple times, recovered, written
                        out by hand at one point, and then re-typed back into
                        the word processor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently it sits at 80k+ words, has a logical plot with
                        beginning / middle / end, and has an array of odd
                        characters living in modern day London. I have persisted
                        with trying to finish this book on and off now for a
                        ludicrously long time which has shown me one thing; I
                        really want to be a writer! I want to stop dreaming and
                        give this some serious consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So kindly let an amateur author with a near complete dog
                        end of a book share their experience, and maybe offer
                        some (hopefully) useful advice if you are thinking of
                        writing a book yourself.

                    <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I had no story. I had no characters. I had no plan. I
                        had a blank page and a keyboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always loved reading; from Goosebumps books as a
                        kid to Terry Pratchett, from Russian masters like
                        Dostoevsky and Bulgakov to Irish classics by Flann
                        O'Brian and Donleavy (Irish-American) and many other
                        weird and interesting authors. I believe reading well
                        improves your chances of writing well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I read books that satisfy my own imagination, and that
                        in turn has helped inspire me to explore my imagination
                        to see what it can conjure up.
                    </p>
                    <p>Getting started came down these few points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reading a lot of books.</li>
                        <li>Having quiet and private space to myself.</li>
                        <li>
                            Not caring too much about what I was writing at the
                            time.
                        </li>
                        <li>Just starting and seeing how it felt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The fact that 20 years have passed since then may sound
                        like I haven't exactly taken this new found passion on
                        board in any serious way at all, but it has stayed with
                        me, always in the back of my mind. For me, the past few
                        months have a been a breakthrough in getting towards the
                        end, and ironing out the characters and plot.

                    <h2>What Kept Me Going</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is an interesting question. If I had such a strong
                        desire to write a book, and had already started one,
                        then why have I stopped so many times, only to
                        half-heartedly keep coming back to then stop again?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it's because I have not been trying to impress
                        anyone, I've been doing my own thing in my own time. I
                        wrote when the mood took me, and I never felt an urgency
                        in getting to the end. I think not having any sort of
                        structure or plan facilitated this. If I had the ending
                        in my head, and I knew how each character would develop
                        then I would have a story inside me waiting to burst
                        out. Over the years, I've winged every word and event on
                        the day I sat down in front of my computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'd say the key things that kept me going were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A genuine appreciation of what I had already
                            written.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A fun sense of the unknown - what will I write
                            today? I have no idea!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A quiet understanding that I wanted to get to the
                            end, regardless of how long it was going to take.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I would say write for yourself. If this is your first
                        book and you're experimenting, don't go thinking this is
                        the start of my new career and I'm going to land a fat
                        publishing contract so this book has to be perfect.
                        Write something that excites you, and that you would
                        want to read.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mistakes I've Made</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm not going to roast myself too harshly here. I know
                        my book has issues, but I'm just an amateur having some
                        fun. It goes without saying that writing 19 chapters of
                        text for a story that's been made up on the fly is going
                        to have inconsistencies and errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why am I considering mistakes, when I've stated I am
                        writing this for my own enjoyment, and am not attempting
                        to impress anyone? Surely it's what I wanted to write at
                        the time, and that should be good enough? Yes, there is
                        truth in this, but in the last few months I have decided
                        I want to try and get this thing published. I am looking
                        at "mistakes" from the perspective of the reader who is
                        going to pick holes in the plot and the timeline, and
                        every other aspect of the book for that matter. I'd like
                        it to make logical sense, while keeping as much of my
                        original ramblings as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An honest appraisal of the mistakes I've made would have
                        to include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A complete lack of planning. While this gave me
                            unbounded creative freedom, as the book grew, it
                            turned into a mess of scenes, rather than a coherent
                            storyline building towards a climax.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Not knowing the backstory of the characters before
                            starting. This resulted in characters that were not
                            developing in an engaging way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Trying to use flowery language too often. This made
                            sentences too long, producing waffle that stunted
                            the flow of the text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Trying to be funny on virtually every line. The
                            novel is a comic farce of sorts, and this was
                            actually killing the humour rather than adding to
                            it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Writing scenes that take place over weeks or months,
                            but the flow was jumpy and hard to follow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Going back and seeing these issues has given me more
                        motivation to finish, as I want to produce something
                        that makes sense, at a minimum. Fixing stuff is also
                        helping me drive the story because I can take out bits
                        that don't fit, and add connections to events I created
                        later in the book.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How I'm Fixing My First Novel</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've read the manuscript back and corrected of lot of
                        grammar, tidied up the prose, and cut out parts that
                        didn't stack up. I've rewritten several parts of it
                        based off the mistakes identified in the last section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The specific methods I'm using to improve the book are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Creating a short survey for each character,
                            detailing their personal bio and role in story.
                        </li>
                        <li>Making a timeline of events.</li>
                        <li>
                            Axing fluff to reduce sentence length so the point
                            hits cleanly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reducing comic elements in general prose to enhance
                            the humour of the core comic scenes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Planned the ending! I have actually sat down, looked
                            at what I already have, and created an ending. I
                            have a goal, and this is helping to me write more
                            consistently.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        To answer the 'How Hard Can It Be To Write A Book?'
                        question, I would say the writing of it is not that
                        difficult. Pure writing with no structure or limits is
                        joyous; I found it therapeutic even to sit and relax and
                        let my thoughts spill on to the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Writing a book that has depth of character, a strong
                        plot, and a clear lore is not easy. This is essential
                        what I failed to do on the first run, and now I'm
                        backtracking to glue it all together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When, not if, I write my next book, I will start with a
                        knowledge of who my characters are, I will start by
                        knowing the ending, and I will design a killer opening
                        chapter to get the reader hooked immediately. Armed with
                        those tools, I will then employ my free-flow style to
                        all the bits in the middle, always having the final
                        destination to guide, and motivate me if I loose focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many thanks for reading.</p>
